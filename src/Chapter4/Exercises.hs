-- derivative 0.1 does not produce the exact id function as 0.1 is not stored perfectly in binary floating point number.
-- This leads to an accumelated rounding point error when computed

-- with derivative 1 get a constant error of 0.25
-- with derivative 10 get a constant error of 25
-- with derivative 0.1 get a constant error of 0.0025
-- derivative 2 error 1
-- derivative 3 error 2.25
-- derivative 4 error 4
-- derivative 5 error 6.25
-- error = stepValue ** 2 / 4

-- 4.3
-- error > 10%, derivative x**3 
-- derivative 0.1 constant error of 0.0025, so need x where (0.0025 / 3*x**2) > 0.1
-- x < (0.025/3) ** (1/2)
-- x < 9.128709291752768e-2
-- so x = 0.09 should create error greater than 10%, yes 10.288065843621437%
